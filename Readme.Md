## 🔍 Overview

Each experiment includes:

- A clearly defined **objective**
- **Hardware implementation** using logic trainer board and ICs
- **EWB (Electronics Workbench) simulations** using both:
  - Gate-level circuits
  - IC-based virtual circuits
- Complete **truth tables** for verification
- Side-by-side comparisons of manual vs standard IC behavior
